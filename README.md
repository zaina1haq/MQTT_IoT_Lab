## **How to Run the Notebook**

1. **Clone or download** the project folder to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.
3. Install all required libraries (listed below).
4. Open the notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook heart_disease.ipynb
```

5. Run all cells sequentially:
   - Press **Kernel → Restart & Run All**

## **Required Libraries**

Install all required packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
```

### **Libraries Used in the Notebook**

- `numpy` – numerical operations
- `pandas` – data manipulation
- `matplotlib` – basic visualizations
- `seaborn` – advanced statistical charts

## **Dataset Source**

The dataset used is the **Heart Disease UCI dataset**, commonly found on:


🔗 _Kaggle: Heart Disease Dataset_

Dataset contains medical attributes such as:

- age
- sex
- chest pain type
- resting blood pressure
- cholesterol
- fasting blood sugar
- resting ECG results
- max heart rate
- exercise-induced angina
- oldpeak
- ST slope
- …etc.
